# WineCellarApp
I needed a faster way to access the information on Cellar Tracker than their native app. I made this which:
1. downloads the csv data for a given cellar
2. decodes the information into proper Swift structs
3. Displays the bottles on a list
4. Displays the region of origin for the bottle

A more native way of viewing information about bottles in your cellar from CellarTracker.com.
